Story:
Once upon a time, in a forest there lived a monkey on a berry tree. This tree was near to the banks of the river.
In the same forest, lived a crocodile and his wife. One day the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree.
The kind hearted monkey offered him some berries. The next day, the crocodile came back for more berries as he loved them.
As the days passed by, the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.
